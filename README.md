### A [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) only plugin written in Kotlin to cycle through Villager trades from UI. Inspired by [henkelmax](https://modrinth.com/user/henkelmax)'s mod [Trade Cycling](https://modrinth.com/mod/trade-cycling).

# Features
There are two variants to cycle through trades:
1. **Press F (default)**: Press the button associated with swapping the items to your offhand.
2. **Shift Right Click**: Shift right-click on the villager to cycle through trades. However, this variant is disabled by default, have a look at our [#Config](#Config) section to enable it.

### ðŸš¨ Note: If a villager has no profession or has been traded with, you cannot cycle through trades.

# Config
You can configure which method (or both) should be used to cycle through trades:
```yaml
strategy:
  - KEYBOARD
# - SHIFT_INTERACT
```
'#' in front of a method will disable it.
